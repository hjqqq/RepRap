**SprinterConfiguration.h** is the firmware configuration file for
our RepRap. It is to be used with [Adrian Bowyer's fork of the
Sprinter firmware](https://github.com/AdrianBowyer/RepRapLtd-engineering/tree/master/Production-firmware). Replace his configuration.h
with this one.

**reprap.properties** is the settings for the RepRap Host Software.
Put it in .reprap/reprap.properties on your machine. It contains
the settings for temperatures, dump point, and any other tweaks
we make as time goes on. If you make a satisfactory tweak to
calibration, please commit it!
